# AUTOMATIC-LANGUAGE-DETECTOR
The project, conducted in Python, predicts language based on input data. It employs the 'Train-Test Split' method, dividing the dataset into input (X) and output (Y) columns. The training dataset (80%) is used to fit the machine learning model, while the test dataset (20%) evaluates the model's performance. This approach ensures an 80-20 split, with 80% of observations used for training and the remaining 20% for testing.

Technologies used : Python, Libraries- NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn
● Developed a language prediction model using machine learning in Python to determine the language of input data with 100% accuracy.

● Leveraged Bayes theorem to predict the language of the given text based on probabilistic calculations.

● Utilized the 'Train-Test Split' method to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms
